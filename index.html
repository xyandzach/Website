                The PS One was the first console I ever played on. 
                Given to me by my Dad, I remember staying up on countless
                school nights playing Crash Team Racing. I am happy the 
                console that started the iconic PlayStation console series
                was the console that started my gaming career as well.

                weekend night to play Burnout, Star Wars Battlefront, and GTA. Memory cards

                After the amazing experience I had with the Game Boy SP, I decide that my next
                console would be another handheld. Although the Nintendo DS would be as great 
                of a console for me as the GB SP, it was never the less a vital part of my gaming
                upbringing. Having two screens and a stylus, the DS felt alien to me at the time
                and was the first piece of technology that peaked my interest as to how it was put 
                together and operated. Definitely  something that helped kick start my general interest
                in tech.

                Another revolutionary console for me, the Xbox 360 was the first 
                console to expose me to online multiplayer. Although I had a
                few online experiences with my Xbox and DS, Xbox 360 games like Halo 3, Call of
                Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and Red Dead Redemption made it so I was

            <p>
                A proud accomplishment of mine, my custom built PC. I built my PC
                in 2012 when I was age 15. Back then there were far fewer resources
                on PC parts and building online, and no one I knew besides a few friends had
                any knowledge PC building. After years of tinkering and hot swapping parts,
                as well as a recent GPU upgrade on loan, my PC is still able to keep up
                with the latest releases and continues to give me great experiences in gaming.
