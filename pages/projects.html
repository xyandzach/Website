            <h2 class="project-text">Pack-Age</h2>
            <p class="project-description-text">Pack-Age is a user-oriented app created to ease 
                the difficulty of keeping track of multiple packages through multiple carriers. Like 
                most people today, I order a lot of items online. Whether it be through 
                amazon, auction sites like eBay, or other individualistic online outlets, 
                purchasing products online has seen a gigantic uptick in the past decade.
                 Again, like most people I zoom to check where exactly my package is and 
                 when I can expect it at my front door as soon as I receive a tracking 
                 number for my order. The problem that I have run into, and I am sure 
                 most others have as well, is that with so many different carriers and 
                 tracking number formats it is hard to see and keep track of all your 
                 package tracking information in one place. To solve this problem, I 
                 developed Pack-Age, a multi-carrier tracking application that presents 
                 user-friendly features for storing and managing many tracking numbers.</p>

            <p class="project-description-text">Bingeables is a user-oriented website created to let 
                gamers and movie goers keep track and record the video games and movies they have experienced. 
                Websites users will be able to create a custom profile to keep track of the entertainment 
                they have experienced. Once fully published, Bingeables will be able to maintain the details 
                of the movies and games the user adds to their profile watchlist/gamelist. The main design 
                of the site is to provide a record of the movies and games to the user. </p>

            <p class="project-description-text">Simon is a classic table top game that puts your memory
                to the test by flashing a series of colors in a pattern that has to be repeated to further
                the game. Each time the pattern is successfully repeated and addition color is added to the
                end of the pattern to make the game more difficulty the longer it goes on. For one of my electives
                in school I choose to take computer graphics. I was interested in the fundamental processes 
                requried to render and display images of any kind on a screen. In class we learned these fundamentals
                through the use of Java's Swing libraries for 2D rendering and Java3D for 3D rendering. Using the skills
                I learned in this class I was able to develope a implementation of Simon using Java3D.
